  caption: "You may think you mastered derivatives after learning a few simple rules,\
    \ but you could be bewildered if you are\_faced with more complicated functions\
    \ like a matrix determinant (what is a derivative \u201Cwith respect to a matrix\u201D\
    ?), the solution of a differential equation, or other huge practical calculations.\
    \ \_We address such topics by\_re-emphasizing what a derivative really is \u2014\
    \ linearization \u2014\_and refocusing differential calculus on the linear algebra\
    \ at its heart. (Image courtesy of Prof. Steven G. Johnson.)"
