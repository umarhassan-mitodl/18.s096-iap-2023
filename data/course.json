  "course_description": "We all know that calculus courses such as {{% resource_link \"433d2644-7d53-4c0c-beb3-f5c117fabfc7\" \"*18.01 Single Variable Calculus*\" %}} and {{% resource_link \"eef52057-2378-49ea-a937-e47025160784\" \"*18.02 Multivariable Calculus*\" %}} cover univariate and vector calculus, respectively. Modern applications such as machine learning and large-scale optimization require the next big step, \"matrix calculus\" and calculus on arbitrary vector spaces.\n\nThis class covers a coherent approach to matrix calculus showing techniques that allow you to think of a matrix holistically (not just as an array of scalars), generalize and compute derivatives of important matrix factorizations and many other complicated-looking operations, and understand how differentiation formulas must be reimagined in large-scale computing.",
